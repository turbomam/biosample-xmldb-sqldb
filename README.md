# biosample-xmldb-sqldb

This repository provides an end-to-end pipeline to extract [NCBI BioSample](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/biosample) data from XML, transform it, and load into a normalized PostgreSQL database for analytics and project-specific ETL, like instantiating NMDC Biosample objects.

Don't forget to look though (or contribute to) the [issues](https://github.com/turbomam/biosample-basex/issues) and TODOs below

## Codebase and Architecture 

The repository contains:

- A Makefile for pipeline orchestration
- SQL files that define the PostgreSQL schema
- Python scripts for ETL logic

The key components are:

- The `Makefile` - Defines pipeline tasks and orchestration logic
- `biosample_xmldb_sqldb/biosample_xml_to_relational.py` - Extracts BioSample data and loads into normalized tables
- `biosample_xmldb_sqldb/streaming_pivot_bisample_id_chunks.py` - Pivots attribute data into a wide format

The key scripts are:

### biosample_xml_to_relational.py

- Extracts BioSample, attribute, and metadata into normalized PostgreSQL tables
- Each BioSample is parsed into rows in the `ncbi_attributes_all_long` and `non_attribute_metadata` tables  
- Supports batching and resuming

### streaming_pivot_bisample_id_chunks.py

- Pivots the attribute data into a wide table grouped by `raw_id` 
- Streams data in chunks by BioSample ID range to control memory usage
- Outputs to `ncbi_attributes_harmonized_wide` table

## Database Model

The key tables populated are:

### ncbi_attributes_all_long
Long format table with one row for each NCBI attribute of each Biosample.

### ncbi_attributes_harmonized_wide
A pivot of `ncbi_attributes_all_long` with columns for each harmonized attribute and one row per Biosample. The values include units if available.

### non_attribute_metadata
One row of metadata per Biosample. These columns are populated from XML paths other than `Biosample/Attributes/Attribute`

### ncbi_attributes_harmonized_wide
This **view** combines the two tables described above, avoiding the need to explicitly join them in analytical queries. **It is assumed that most ETLs will use this view as input.**

## Overview

The pipeline includes the following phases:

- Downloading the full BioSample XML dataset (100+ GB compressed)
- Extracting and transforming data into relational PostgreSQL tables
- Pivoting data into an analysis-friendly wide format

## Getting Started

The pipeline is orchestrated end-to-end via `make`, with targets for each stage.

### Requirements

- Docker is installed and running
- Python 3.9+ is installed
- [Python poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) is installed
    -  an environment has been created with `poetry install`

The full pipeline flow and additional options are documented in the [Makefile](Makefile).

Don't forget to run scripts inside a [screen](https://www.gnu.org/software/screen/manual/screen.html) session

The main pipeline tasks are defined in the Makefile and can be run as:

```
make downloads/biosample_set.xml # Download the BioSample XML dataset
make postgres-up                 # Start PostgreSQL container  
make postgres-create             # Create DB and user
make postgres-load               # Load data from BioSample XML    
make postgres-pivot              # Pivot attribute data
make postgres-post-pivot-view    # Create a view of the  pivoted data
```

The pipeline uses a `local/.env` file for Postgres credentials and connections string. A template is provided.

The Makefile downloads **all** of NCBI's BioSample collection and unpacks it, using ~ 100 GB of disk space. The `max-biosamples` option provides support for a quick test/partial load mode. The entire build takes ~ 24 hours and requires an additional ~ 100 GB for the PostgreSQL tables and indices.

## Discussion of NCBI "Attributes" and XML "Attributes"

You will see mentions of the word attributes in two separate and unfortunately confusing contexts:
"NCBI Attributes" refers to specific XML paths NCBI has used under the BioSample records.
"XML attributes" refers to the very basic feature offered by the XML language, in which key/value pairs are asserted within a node's opening tag.

The BioSample XML structure contains a distinction between:

### NCBI Attributes

- Specific `<Attribute>` nodes in a Biosample's `<Attributes>` path  
- Contain Biosample attributes like depth, env_broad_scale, etc.
- Extracted into the `ncbi_attributes_all_long` table

### XML Attributes

- The standard attributes associated with each XML node
- For example `id`, `name`, `url`, etc.
- Attributes are captured from nodes like `Id`, `Link`, etc. as well as the <BioSample> nodes themselves.
- Extracted into the `non_attribute_metadata` table

The entire build of a 105 GB/35 Million BioSample XML dataset takes approximately 2 days. The resulting Postgres database can be dumped with `pg_dump -Fc` to a roughly 4 GB file.

# Additional resources

This repo captures Biosample data from NCBI. Nominally, it (and [EBI BioSamples](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biosamples/)) follow The Genomic Standards Consortium’s MIxS standards.
In reality, all three have significant differences in what attributes they expect for Biosamples of different types, and they take different approaches to validating the attribute values.

# Compared to previous methods using the BaseX XML database

### Advantages

- fewer steps
- lower RAM and CPU usage
- fewer containers
- empty cells aren't a mixture of empty strings and NULLs

### Limitations
- can't search through data from xml nodes that we didn't insert into Postgres database
    - see assets/path_counts.yaml
    - see assets/curl_biosample_xml_examples.txt

# TODOs:

_See also https://github.com/turbomam/biosample-xmldb-sqldb/issues_

- Normalize the values of `harmonized_name` attributes. For example, converting all `depth`s into a single numeric column with a consistent unit. May benefit from quantulum3.
- Normalize `env_broad_scale`
  - merge in envo.db.gz from https://s3.amazonaws.com/bbop-sqlite
- Normalize `model`, `package` and `package_name` to match MIxS [Extensions](https://genomicsstandardsconsortium.github.io/mixs/#extensions) and [Checklists](https://genomicsstandardsconsortium.github.io/mixs/#checklists)
- Extract, flatten and load [BioProject](https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/)'s `bioproject.xml` or some SRA metadata?
- special parsing for paragraph keywords?
- think of a way to extract `BioSample/Description/Comment/Table` paths into something that could go into Postgres
    - like biosample-caption-row-value?
- when creating assets/path_counts.yaml, set a lower threshold for id and link attribute detection or just write all of them to a different table?
- write assets/path_counts.yaml to file when inserting every chunk of rows into Postgres?
- document which paths aren't loaded into Postgres
- could `biosample_xml_to_relational.py` and `streaming_pivot_bisample_id_chunks.py` be interleaved?
- check though several columns to see if '|||' is being used as a delimiter
    - what other delimiters could we use?
    - remember `|||` delimiter when searching columns like `bp_id`
    - would fts help here? the bp_ids are integers, not words
- add a "resume at" feature. Might also require a "cleanup from" feature.
- improve FTS query experience 
    - see `sql/experimental-factor-fts-query.sql`
- use different disks for reading biosample_set.xml and writing to Postgres
- keep A and B Postgres databases (prod and stage)
- remove duplicated config stuff in `local/.env` and at top of `Makefile`
